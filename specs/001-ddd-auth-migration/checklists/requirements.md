# Specification Quality Checklist: DDD Auth Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Assumptions section documents technology choices that will be decided during planning phase
- The "Project Structure Requirements" and "Assumptions" sections provide context for implementation but don't prescribe specific technical solutions at the requirements level
